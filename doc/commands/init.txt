homer init [options]

Sets up your home directory for use with Homer. By default, it simply
initializes a new Git repo in $HOME and copies template files into it,
but you can optionally pass in a Git repo to use as an existing store
for your home directory.

OPTIONS:

  -c    Instead of initializing a new Git repo, clones the existing one
        to /tmp and merges your $HOME directory with it.
