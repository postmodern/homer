Homer is a command\-line utility to manage your shell\'s home directory\. It turns your entire home directory into a Git repo so you can version control non\-sensitive configuration and data and synchronize them across machines\. It also includes provisions for installing custom shell scripts, aliases and hooks for package management tooling\. Homer is designed around the Unix philosophy, and stays out of your way as much as possible\. It is written entirely in ZSH shell script\.
