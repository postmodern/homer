.SH DESCRIPTION

Homer is a command\-line utility to manage your shell\[cq]s home directory\.
It turns your entire home directory into a Git repo so you can
version control non\-sensitive configuration and data and synchronize
them across machines\. It also includes provisions for installing custom
shell scripts, aliases and hooks for package management tooling\. Homer
is designed around the Unix philosophy, and stays out of your way as
much as possible\. It is written entirely in ZSH shell script\.
