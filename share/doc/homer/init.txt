homer init [REPOSITORY] [options]

Sets up your home directory for use with Homer. By default, it
initializes a new Git repo in $HOME and copies in the base template
files/directories, but you can optionally pass in a remote Git repo URL
to form the base for your home directory configuration. This is useful
if you maintain a "dotfiles" repo and want to copy your configuration
between machines.

OPTIONS:

  -m MESSAGE    Customize the initial message when committing to Git.
